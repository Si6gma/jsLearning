# Learning JS
Hello There. I'm *Si6gma* and I'm learning how to code in JS.
## Using Udemy
I will be using [***this***](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) course. Overall it's very good. Will keep updating my progress percentage here.
#
```cs
"Current Completion Percentage": 11%
```

### Note:
When I created this repository I already started this project and was done with 39 lectures, so I won't upload the things I've already done.
#
## Overall Objective
Able to make good looking websites for my own portfolio then go in competitions and have fun. Don't question why I made this.
#
```
Let's hope this goes well...
